You must write a program which reads, processes and reports on the contents of a text file.

Your program should:

<ol>

 <li>Read the name of the text file from the console.</li>

 <li>Read in a text file, line by line.</li>

 <li>Split each line into words, discarding punctuation and folding all letters into lower case.</li>

 <li>Store the unique words and maintain a count of each different word.</li>

 <li>Sort the words first by increasing count and, if there are multiple words with the same count, alphabetically.</li>

 <li>Output the first ten words in the sorted list, along with their counts.</li>

 <li>Output the last ten words in the list, along with their counts.</li>

</ol>

You must choose <strong>appropriate</strong> data structures and algorithms to accomplish this task.

<strong>Note: in the context of this assignment, appropriate choices will be efficient and will not use excessive instructions or data. </strong>

Note: where a punctuation mark appears between two letters, the sequence is to be treated as a single word. Thus, <em>it’s</em> will become <em>its</em>, <em>you’ll</em> will become <em>youll</em> and <em>loop-hole</em> will become <em>loophole</em>.

Note: you can assume that the input file contains no more than 50,000 different words.

Note: a small sample input file “sample.txt” is provided for you to test your program.

A larger text file will be used for final assessment.

Note: you may use any data structures or algorithms that have been presented in class up to the end of week 4. If you use other data structures or algorithms appropriate references must be provided.




Programs must compile and run under gcc (C programs), g++ (C++ programs) java or python. Programs which do not compile and run will receive no marks.




Programs should be appropriately documented with comments.




All coding must be your own work. Standard libraries of data structures and algorithms such as STL may not be used, nor may code be sourced from textbooks, the internet, etc.




<strong>Marking Guide: </strong>

Programs submitted must work! A program which fails, to compile or run will receive a mark of zero.

A program which produces the correct output, no matter how inefficient the code, will receive a minimum of 50%.

Additional marks beyond this will be awarded for the appropriateness, i.e. efficiency for this problem, of the algorithms and data structures you use.

Programs which lack clarity, both in code and comments, will lose marks.




<strong>             </strong>

<strong>Submission: </strong>

Assignments should be typed into a single text file called ass1.<em>ext</em> where <em>ext</em> is the appropriate file extension for the chosen language. A pdf file describing your solution should also be produced. This file should contain at least:

<ol>

 <li>A high‐level description of the overall solution strategy:</li>

 <li>A list of all of the data structures used, where they are used and the reasons for their choice.</li>

 <li>A list of any standard algorithms used, where they are used and why they are used.</li>

</ol>

Both files should be submitted via the submit program.
